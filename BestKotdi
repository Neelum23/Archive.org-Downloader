There are many fantastic books accessible on http://www.bestkoditips.com/ and http://realclobber.com/Â but, you can only borrow them for 1 hour to 14 days and you don't have the ability to save it as a PDF to read it offline or share it with your friends. I made this tool to fix this problem and obtain the original book in pdf format for FREE !


Of course, the download time depends on the number of pages and the quality of the photographs you've chosen.Â 
Getting Started
To get started you need to have python3 installed. If it is not the case you can download it here : https://www.python.org/downloads/

Installation
Make sure you've already git installed. Then you can run the following commands to get the scripts on your computer:

git clone https://github.com/MiniGlome/Archive.org-Downloader.git
cd Archive.org-Downloader
The script requires the modules requests, tqdm and img2pdf, you can install them all at once with this command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
usage: archive-org-downloader.py [-h] -e EMAIL -p PASSWORD [-u URL] [-d DIR] [-f FILE] [-r RESOLUTION] [-t THREADS] [-j]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e EMAIL, --email EMAIL
                        Your archive.org email
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        Your archive.org password
  -u URL, --url URL     Link to the book (https://archive.org/details/XXXX). You can use this argument several times
                        to download multiple books
  -d DIR, --dir DIR     Output directory
  -f FILE, --file FILE  File where are stored the URLs of the books to download
  -r RESOLUTION, --resolution RESOLUTION
                        Image resolution (10 to 0, 0 is the highest), [default 3]
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads, [default 50]
  -j, --jpg             Output to individual JPG's rather then a PDF
The email and password fields are required, so to use this script you must have a registered account on archive.org. The -r argument specifies the resolution of the images (0 is the best quality). The PDF are downloaded in the current folder

Example
This command will download the 3 books as pdf in the best possible quality. To only downlaod the individual images you can use --jpg.

python3 archive-org-downloader.py -e myemail@tempmail.com -p Passw0rd -r 0 -u https://archive.org/details/IntermediatePython -u https://archive.org/details/horrorgamispooky0000bidd_m7r1 -u https://archive.org/details/elblabladelosge00gaut 
If you want to download a lot of books in a raw you can paste the urls of the books in a .txt file (one per line) and use --file

python3 archive-org-downloader.py -e myemail@tempmail.com -p Passw0rd --file books_to_download.txt
